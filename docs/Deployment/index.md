title: Deployment

For users that don't want to deploy CrossCopy on their own, we provide a cloud service. All downloaded client apps by default use our service.

CrossCopy is an open source project, and allows user to deploy their own server for privacy and security converns.

For example, clipboard data can contain sensitive information, or your computers cannot connect to public network. In these scenarios you can self-deploy CrossCopy within your own network.

I tried to make deployment as simple as possible, so that you can deploy CrossCopy with little or even zero configuration.

Client apps on all platforms will have a server setting that allows you to point the app to your own deployment.

The recommanded way of deployment is using Docker.
