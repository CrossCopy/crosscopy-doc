I use [oclif](https://oclif.io/) to build CLI, it has a very smart design (OOP) for command and argument parsing.

:::caution
I still didn't figure out how to release package to apt, brew, etc. [Release Documentation](https://oclif.io/docs/releasing) is available, but I can't get it working. There is not much tutorials online.

A Node.js needs to be installed, the app now can be installed with `npm i -g crosscopy`.
