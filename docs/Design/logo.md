## V2 Design

<div style={{paddingBottom: "1em", display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

<img width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrossCopy/crosscopy-logo/main/designs/v2-squares/CrossCopy-Logo.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABVPHAF3KWLWZP4H2IPAZYEIYWJCOLA" />
</div>

I don't have any experience in art or logo design, so this is a super simple logo I designed to illustrate the main idea of this project: a server syncing data between multiple devices.
