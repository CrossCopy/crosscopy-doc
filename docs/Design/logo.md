## V2 Design

<div style={{paddingBottom: "1em", display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

<img width="100" src={require('@site/static/img/CrossCopy-Logo.png').default} />

</div>

I don't have any experience in art or logo design, so this is a super simple logo I designed to illustrate the main idea of this project: a server syncing data between multiple devices.
